## Notes

Interpretation of an unfinished challenge I started sometime in 2014, but have a lot of things working anyway.

## Challenge

Using Node.js with Socket.IO build a math trivia game. The game should allow for one or more players from multiple locations to participate. A question should appear on the screen, and the first player to submit the correct answer should be awarded points. Anyone can join and leave the room.
